# Angular5-Webpack
This is a custom Compiler for Webpack using Angular 5 without the need of Angular-CLI

This is currently in a private repository during testing.
This seed Project allows for the use of custom webpack.config.js file to be implemented with Angular 5.0.1

## Update
Currently I have 2 models of the Angular+Webpack project.





## Contact
Contact me if you would like to have access to the repository during its early stages of testing.
